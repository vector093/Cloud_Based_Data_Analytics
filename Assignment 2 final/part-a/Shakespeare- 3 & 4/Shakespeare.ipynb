creatures we desire increase&#39;,\n &#34; That thereby beauty&#39;s rose might never die&#34;,\n &#39; But as the riper should by time decease&#39;,\n &#39; His tender heir might bear his memory&#39;,\n &#39; But thou contracted to thine own bright eyes&#39;,\n &#34; Feed&#39;st thy light&#39;s flame with self substantial fuel&#34;,\n &#39; Making a famine where abundance lies&#39;,\n &#39; Thy self thy foe to thy sweet self too cruel&#39;,\n &#34; Thou that art now the world&#39;s fresh ornament&#34;,\n &#39; And only herald to the gaudy spring&#39;,\n &#39; Within thine own bud buriest thy content&#39;,\n &#34; And tender churl mak&#39;st waste in niggarding&#34;,\n &#39; Pity the world or else this glutton be&#39;,\n &#34; To eat the world&#39;s due by the grave and thee&#34;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39; 2&#39;,\n &#39; When forty winters shall besiege thy brow&#39;,\n &#34; And dig deep trenches in thy beauty&#39;s field&#34;,\n &#34; Thy youth&#39;s proud livery so gazed on now&#34;,\n &#39; Will be a tattered weed of small worth held&#39;,\n &#39; Then being asked where all thy beauty lies&#39;,\n &#39; Where all the treasure of thy lusty days&#39;,\n &#39; To say within thine own deep sunken eyes&#39;,\n &#39; Were an all eating shame and thriftless praise&#39;,\n &#34; How much more praise deserved thy beauty&#39;s use&#34;,\n &#34; If thou couldst answer &#39;This fair child of mine&#34;,\n &#34; Shall sum my count and make my old excuse&#39;&#34;,\n &#39; Proving his beauty by succession thine&#39;,\n &#39; This were to be new made when thou art old&#39;,\n &#34; And see thy blood warm when thou feel&#39;st it cold&#34;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39; 3&#39;,\n &#39; Look in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest&#39;,\n &#39; Now is the time that face should form another&#39;,\n &#39; Whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest&#39;,\n &#39; Thou dost beguile the world unbless some mother&#39;,\n &#39; For where is she so fair whose uneared womb&#39;,\n &#39; Disdains the tillage of thy husbandry&#39;,\n &#39; Or who is he so fond will be the tomb&#39;,\n &#39; Of his self love to stop posterity&#39;,\n &#34; Thou art thy mother&#39;s glass and she in thee&#34;,\n &#39; Calls back the lovely April of her prime&#39;,\n &#39; So thou through windows of thine age shalt see&#39;,\n &#39; Despite of wrinkles this thy golden time&#39;,\n &#39; But if thou live remembered not to be&#39;,\n &#39; Die single and thine image dies with thee&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39; 4&#39;,\n &#39; Unthrifty loveliness why dost thou spend&#39;,\n &#34; Upon thy self thy beauty&#39;s legacy&#34;,\n &#34; Nature&#39;s bequest gives nothing but doth lend&#34;,\n &#39; And being frank she lends to those are free&#39;,\n &#39; Then beauteous niggard why dost thou abuse&#39;,\n &#39; The bounteous largess given thee to give&#39;,\n &#39; Profitless usurer why dost thou use&#39;,\n &#39; So great a sum of sums yet canst not live&#39;,\n &#39; For having traffic with thy self alone&#39;,\n &#39; Thou of thy self thy sweet self dost deceive&#39;,\n &#39; Then how when nature calls thee to be gone&#39;,\n &#39; What acceptable audit canst thou leave&#39;,\n &#39; Thy unused beauty must be tombed with thee&#39;,\n &#34; Which used lives th&#39; executor to be&#34;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39; 5&#39;,\n &#39; Those hours that with gentle work did frame&#39;,\n &#39; The lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell&#39;,\n &#39; Will play the tyrants to the very same&#39;,\n &#39; And that unfair which fairly doth excel&#39;,\n &#39; For never resting time leads summer on&#39;,\n &#39; To hideous winter and confounds him there&#39;,\n &#39; Sap checked with frost and lusty leaves quite gone&#39;,\n &#34; Beauty o&#39;er snowed and bareness every where&#34;,\n &#34; Then were not summer&#39;s distillation left&#34;,\n &#39; A liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass&#39;,\n &#34; Beauty&#39;s effect with beauty were bereft&#34;,\n &#39; Nor it nor no remembrance what it was&#39;,\n &#39; But flowers distilled though they with winter meet&#39;,\n &#39; Leese but their show their substance still lives sweet&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39; 6&#39;,\n &#34; Then let not winter&#39;s ragged hand deface&#34;,\n &#39; In thee thy summer ere thou be distilled&#39;,\n &#39; Make sweet some vial treasure thou some place&#39;,\n &#34; With beauty&#39;s treasure ere it be self killed&#34;,\n &#39; That use is not forbidden usury&#39;,\n &#39; Which happies those that pay the willing loan&#39;,\n &#34; That&#39;s for thy self to breed another thee&#34;,\n &#39; Or ten times happier be it ten for one&#39;,\n &#39; Ten times thy self were happier than thou art&#39;,\n &#39; If ten of thine ten times refigured thee&#39;,\n &#39; Then what could death do if thou shouldst depart&#39;,\n &#39; Leaving thee living in posterity&#39;,\n &#39; Be not self willed for thou art much too fair&#39;,\n &#34; To be death&#39;s conquest and make worms thine heir&#34;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39; 7&#39;,\n &#39; Lo in the orient when the gracious light&#39;,\n &#39; Lifts up his burning head each under eye&#39;,\n &#39; Doth homage to his new appearing sight&#39;,\n &#39; Serving with looks his sacred majesty&#39;,\n &#39; And having climbed the steep up heavenly hill&#39;,\n &#39; Resembling strong youth in his middle age&#39;,\n &#39; Yet mortal looks adore his beauty still&#39;,\n &#39; Attending on his golden pilgrimage&#39;,\n &#39; But when from highmost pitch with weary car&#39;,\n &#39; Like feeble age he reeleth from the day&#39;,\n &#39; The eyes fore duteous now converted are&#39;,\n &#39; From his low tract and look another way&#39;,\n &#39; So thou thy self out going in thy noon&#39;,\n &#39; Unlooked on diest unless thou get a son&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39; 8&#39;,\n &#34; Music to hear why hear&#39;st thou music sadly&#34;,\n &#39; Sweets with sweets war not joy delights in joy&#39;,\n &#34; Why lov&#39;st thou that which thou receiv&#39;st not gladly&#34;,\n &#34; Or else receiv&#39;st with pleasure thine annoy&#34;,\n &#39; If the true concord of well tuned sounds&#39;,\n &#39; By unions married do offend thine ear&#39;,\n &#39; They do but sweetly chide thee who confounds&#39;,\n &#39; In singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear&#39;,\n &#39; Mark how one string sweet husband to another&#39;,\n &#39; Strikes each in each by mutual ordering&#39;,\n &#39; Resembling sire and child and happy mother&#39;,\n &#39; Who all in one one pleasing note do sing&#39;,\n &#39; Whose speechless song being many seeming one&#39;,\n &#34; Sings this to thee &#39;Thou single wilt prove none&#39;&#34;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39; 9&#39;,\n &#34; Is it for fear to wet a widow&#39;s eye&#34;,\n &#34; That thou consum&#39;st thy self in single life&#34;,\n &#39; Ah if thou issueless shalt hap to die&#39;,\n &#39; The world will wail thee like a makeless wife&#39;,\n &#39; The world will be thy widow and still weep&#39;,\n &#39; That thou no form of thee hast left behind&#39;,\n &#39; When every private widow well may keep&#39;,\n &#34; By children&#39;s eyes her husband&#39;s shape in mind&#34;,\n &#39; Look what an unthrift in the world doth spend&#39;,\n &#39; Shifts but his place for still the world enjoys it&#39;,\n &#34; But beauty&#39;s waste hath in the world an end&#34;,\n &#39; And kept unused the user so destroys it&#39;,\n &#39; No love toward others in that bosom sits&#39;,\n &#34; That on himself such murd&#39;rous shame commits&#34;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39; 10&#39;,\n &#34; For shame deny that thou bear&#39;st love to any&#34;,\n &#39; Who for thy self art so unprovident&#39;,\n &#39; Grant if thou wilt thou art beloved of many&#39;,\n &#34; But that thou none lov&#39;st is most evident&#34;,\n &#34; For thou art so possessed with murd&#39;rous hate&#34;,\n &#34; That &#39;gainst thy self thou stick&#39;st not to conspire&#34;,\n &#39; Seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate&#39;,\n &#39; Which to repair should be thy chief desire&#39;,\n &#39; O change thy thought that I may change my mind&#39;,\n &#39; Shall hate be fairer lodged than gentle love&#39;,\n &#39; Be as thy presence is gracious and kind&#39;,\n &#39; Or to thy self at least kind hearted prove&#39;,\n &#39; Make thee another self for love of me&#39;,\n &#39; That beauty still may live in thine or thee&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39; 11&#39;,\n &#34; As fast as thou shalt wane so fast thou grow&#39;st&#34;,\n &#39; In one of thine from that which thou departest&#39;,\n &#34; And that fresh blood which youngly thou bestow&#39;st&#34;,\n &#39; Thou mayst call thine when thou from youth convertest&#39;,\n &#39; Herein lives wisdom beauty and increase&#39;,\n &#39; Without this folly age and cold decay&#39;,\n &#39; If all were minded so the times should cease&#39;,\n &#39; And threescore year would make the world away&#39;,\n &#39; Let those whom nature hath not made for store&#39;,\n &#39; Harsh featureless and rude barrenly perish&#39;,\n &#39; Look whom she best endowed she gave thee more&#39;,\n &#39; Which bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish&#39;,\n &#39; She carved thee for her seal and meant thereby&#39;,\n &#39; Thou shouldst print more not let that copy die&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39; 12&#39;,\n &#39; When I do count the clock that tells the time&#39;,\n &#39; And see the brave day sunk in hideous night&#39;,\n &#39; When I behold the violet past prime&#39;,\n &#34; And sable curls all silvered o&#39;er with white&#34;,\n &#39; When lofty trees I see barren of leaves&#39;,\n &#39; Which erst from heat did canopy the herd&#39;,\n &#34; And summer&#39;s green all girded up in sheaves&#34;,\n &#39; Borne on the bier with white and bristly beard&#39;,\n &#39; Then of thy beauty do I question make&#39;,\n &#39; That thou among the wastes of time must go&#39;,\n &#39; Since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake&#39;,\n &#39; And die as fast as they see others grow&#39;,\n &#34; And nothing &#39;gainst Time&#39;s scythe can make defence&#34;,\n &#39; Save breed to brave him when he takes thee hence&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39; 13&#39;,\n &#39; O that you were your self but love you are&#39;,\n &#39; No longer yours than you your self here live&#39;,\n &#39; Against this coming end you should prepare&#39;,\n &#39; And your sweet semblance to some other give&#39;,\n &#39; So should that beauty which you hold in lease&#39;,\n &#39; Find no determination then you were&#39;,\n &#34; Your self again after your self&#39;s decease&#34;,\n &#39; When your sweet issue your sweet form should bear&#39;,\n &#39; Who lets so fair a house fall to decay&#39;,\n &#39; Which husbandry in honour might uphold&#39;,\n &#34; Against the stormy gusts of winter&#39;s day&#34;,\n &#34; And barren rage of death&#39;s eternal cold&#34;,\n &#39; O none but unthrifts dear my love you know&#39;,\n &#39; You had a father let your son say so&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39; 14&#39;,\n &#39; Not from the stars do I my judgement pluck&#39;,\n &#39; And yet methinks I have astronomy&#39;,\n &#39; But not to tell of good or evil luck&#39;,\n &#34; Of plagues of dearths or seasons&#39; quality&#34;,\n &#39; Nor can I fortune to brief minutes tell&#39;,\n &#39; Pointing to each his thunder rain and wind&#39;,\n &#39; Or say with princes if it shall go well&#39;,\n &#39; By oft predict that I in heaven find&#39;,\n &#39; But from thine eyes my knowledge I derive&#39;,\n &#39; And constant stars in them I read such art&#39;,\n &#39; As truth and beauty shall together thrive&#39;,\n &#39; If from thy self to store thou wouldst convert&#39;,\n &#39; Or else of thee this I prognosticate&#39;,\n &#34; Thy end is truth&#39;s and beauty&#39;s doom and date&#34;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39; 15&#39;,\n &#39; When I consider every thing that grows&#39;,\n &#39; Holds in perfection but a little moment&#39;,\n &#39; That this huge stage presenteth nought but shows&#39;,\n &#39; Whereon the stars in secret influence comment&#39;,\n &#39; When I perceive that men as plants increase&#39;,\n &#39; Cheered and checked even by the self same sky&#39;,\n &#39; Vaunt in their youthful sap at height decrease&#39;,\n &#39; And wear their brave state out of memory&#39;,\n &#39; Then the conceit of this inconstant stay&#39;,\n &#39; Sets you most rich in youth before my sight&#39;,\n &#39; Where wasteful time debateth with decay&#39;,\n &#39; To change your day of youth to sullied night&#39;,\n &#39; And all in war with Time for love of you&#39;,\n &#39; As he takes from you I engraft you new&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39; 16&#39;,\n &#39; But wherefore do not you a mightier way&#39;,\n &#39; Make war upon this bloody tyrant Time&#39;,\n &#39; And fortify your self in your decay&#39;,\n &#39; With means more blessed than my barren rhyme&#39;,\n &#39; Now stand you on the top of happy hours&#39;,\n &#39; And many maiden gardens yet unset&#39;,\n &#39; With virtuous wish would bear you living flowers&#39;,\n &#39; Much liker than your painted counterfeit&#39;,\n &#39; So should the lines of life that life repair&#39;,\n &#34; Which this Time&#39;s pencil or my pupil pen&#34;,\n &#39; Neither in inward worth nor outward fair&#39;,\n &#39; Can make you live your self in eyes of men&#39;,\n &#39; To give away your self keeps your self still&#39;,\n &#39; And you must live drawn by your own sweet skill&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39; 17&#39;,\n &#39; Who will believe my verse in time to come&#39;,\n &#39; If it were filled with your most high deserts&#39;,\n &#39; Though yet heaven knows it is but as a tomb&#39;,\n &#39; Which hides your life and shows not half your parts&#39;,\n &#39; If I could write the beauty of your eyes&#39;,\n &#39; And in fresh numbers number all your graces&#39;,\n &#39; The age to come would say this poet lies&#39;,\n &#34; Such heavenly touches ne&#39;er touched earthly faces&#34;,\n &#39; So should my papers yellowed with their age&#39;,\n &#39; Be scorned like old men of less truth than tongue&#39;,\n &#34; And your true rights be termed a poet&#39;s rage&#34;,\n &#39; And stretched metre of an antique song&#39;,\n &#39; But were some child of yours alive that time&#39;,\n &#39; You should live twice in it and in my rhyme&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39; 18&#39;,\n &#34; Shall I compare thee to a summer&#39;s day&#34;,\n &#39; Thou art more lovely and more temperate&#39;,\n &#39; Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May&#39;,\n &#34; And summer&#39;s lease hath all too short a date&#34;,\n &#39; Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines&#39;,\n &#39; And often is his gold complexion dimmed&#39;,\n &#39; And every fair from fair sometime declines&#39;,\n &#34; By chance or nature&#39;s changing course untrimmed&#34;,\n &#39; But thy eternal summer shall not fade&#39;,\n &#34; Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow&#39;st&#34;,\n &#34; Nor shall death brag thou wand&#39;rest in his shade&#34;,\n &#34; When in eternal lines to time thou grow&#39;st&#34;,\n &#39; So long as men can breathe or eyes can see&#39;,\n &#39; So long lives this and this gives life to thee&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39; 19&#39;,\n &#34; Devouring Time blunt thou the lion&#39;s paws&#34;,\n &#39; And make the earth devour her own sweet brood&#39;,\n &#34; Pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tiger&#39;s jaws&#34;,\n &#39; And burn the long lived phoenix in her blood&#39;,\n &#34; Make glad and sorry seasons as thou fleet&#39;st&#34;,\n &#34; And do whate&#39;er thou wilt swift footed Time&#34;,\n &#39; To the wide world and all her fading sweets&#39;,\n &#39; But I forbid thee one most heinous crime&#39;,\n &#34; O carve not with thy hours my love&#39;s fair brow&#34;,\n &#39; Nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen&#39;,\n &#39; Him in thy course untainted do allow&#39;,\n &#34; For beauty&#39;s pattern to succeeding men&#34;,\n &#39; Yet do thy worst old Time despite thy wrong&#39;,\n &#39; My love shall in my verse ever live young&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39; 20&#39;,\n &#34; A woman&#39;s face with nature&#39;s own hand painted&#34;,\n &#39; Hast thou the master mistress of my passion&#39;,\n &#34; A woman&#39;s gentle heart but not acquainted&#34;,\n &#34; With shifting change as is false women&#39;s fashion&#34;,\n &#39; An eye more bright than theirs less false in rolling&#39;,\n &#39; Gilding the object whereupon it gazeth&#39;,\n &#39; A man in hue all hues in his controlling&#39;,\n &#34; Which steals men&#39;s eyes and women&#39;s souls amazeth&#34;,\n &#39; And for a woman wert thou first created&#39;,\n &#39; Till nature as she wrought thee fell a doting&#39;,\n &#39; And by addition me of thee defeated&#39;,\n &#39; By adding one thing to my purpose nothing&#39;,\n &#34; But since she pricked thee out for women&#39;s pleasure&#34;,\n &#34; Mine be thy love and thy love&#39;s use their treasure&#34;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39; 21&#39;,\n &#39; So is it not with me as with that muse&#39;,\n &#39; Stirred by a painted beauty to his verse&#39;,\n &#39; Who heaven it self for ornament doth use&#39;,\n &#39; And every fair with his fair doth rehearse&#39;,\n &#39; Making a couplement of proud compare&#39;,\n &#34; With sun and moon with earth and sea&#39;s rich gems&#34;,\n &#34; With April&#39;s first born flowers and all things rare&#34;,\n &#34; That heaven&#39;s air in this huge rondure hems&#34;,\n &#39; O let me true in love but truly write&#39;,\n &#39; And then believe me my love is as fair&#39;,\n &#34; As any mother&#39;s child though not so bright&#34;,\n &#34; As those gold candles fixed in heaven&#39;s air&#34;,\n &#39; Let them say more that like of hearsay well&#39;,\n &#39; I will not praise that purpose not to sell&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39; 22&#39;,\n &#39; My glass shall not persuade me I am old&#39;,\n &#39; So long as youth and thou are of one date&#39;,\n &#34; But when in thee time&#39;s furrows I behold&#34;,\n &#39; Then look I death my days should expiate&#39;,\n &#39; For all that beauty that doth cover thee&#39;,\n &#39; Is but the seemly raiment of my heart&#39;,\n &#39; Which in thy breast doth live as thine in me&#39;,\n &#39; How can I then be elder than thou art&#39;,\n &#39; O therefore love be of thyself so wary&#39;,\n &#39; As I not for my self but for thee will&#39;,\n &#39; Bearing thy heart which I will keep so chary&#39;,\n &#39; As tender nurse her babe from faring ill&#39;,\n &#39; Presume not on thy heart when mine is slain&#39;,\n &#34; Thou gav&#39;st me thine not to give back again&#34;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39; 23&#39;,\n &#39; As an unperfect actor on the stage&#39;,\n &#39; Who with his fear is put beside his part&#39;,\n &#39; Or some fierce thing replete with too much rage&#39;,\n &#34; Whose strength&#39;s abundance weakens his own heart&#34;,\n &#39; So I for fear of trust forget to say&#39;,\n &#34; The perfect ceremony of love&#39;s rite&#34;,\n &#34; And in mine own love&#39;s strength seem to decay&#34;,\n &#34; O&#39;ercharged with burthen of mine own love&#39;s might&#34;,\n &#39; O let my looks be then the eloquence&#39;,\n &#39; And dumb presagers of my speaking breast&#39;,\n &#39; Who plead for love and look for recompense&#39;,\n &#39; More than that tongue that more hath more expressed&#39;,\n &#39; O learn to read what silent love hath writ&#39;,\n &#34; To hear with eyes belongs to love&#39;s fine wit&#34;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39; 24&#39;,\n &#39; Mine eye hath played the painter and hath stelled&#39;,\n &#34; Thy beauty&#39;s form in table of my heart&#34;,\n &#34; My body is the frame wherein &#39;tis held&#34;,\n &#34; And perspective it is best painter&#39;s art&#34;,\n &#39; For through the painter must you see his skill&#39;,\n &#39; To find where your true image pictured lies&#39;,\n &#34; Which in my bosom&#39;s shop is hanging still&#34;,\n &#39; That hath his windows glazed with thine eyes&#39;,\n &#39; Now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done&#39;,\n &#39; Mine eyes have drawn thy shape and thine for me&#39;,\n &#39; Are windows to my breast where through the sun&#39;,\n &#39; Delights to peep to gaze therein on thee&#39;,\n &#39; Yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art&#39;,\n &#39; They draw but what they see know not the heart&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39; 25&#39;,\n &#39; Let those who are in favour with their stars&#39;,\n &#39; Of public honour and proud titles boast&#39;,\n &#39; Whilst I whom fortune of such triumph bars&#39;,\n &#39; Unlooked for joy in that I honour most&#39;,\n &#34; Great princes&#39; favourites their fair leaves spread&#34;,\n &#34; But as the marigold at the sun&#39;s eye&#34;,\n &#39; And in themselves their pride lies buried&#39;,\n &#39; For at a frown they in their glory die&#39;,\n &#39; The painful warrior famoused for fight&#39;,\n &#39; After a thousand victories once foiled&#39;,\n &#39; Is from the book of honour razed quite&#39;,\n &#39; And all the rest forgot for which he toiled&#39;,\n &#39; Then happy I that love and am beloved&#39;,\n &#39; Where I may not remove nor be removed&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39; 26&#39;,\n &#39; Lord of my love to whom in vassalage&#39;,\n &#39; Thy merit hath my duty strongly knit&#39;,\n &#39; To thee I send this written embassage&#39;,\n &#39; To witness duty not to show my wit&#39;,\n &#39; Duty so great which wit so poor as mine&#39;,\n &#39; May make seem bare in wanting words to show it&#39;,\n &#39; But that I hope some good conceit of thine&#39;,\n &#34; In thy soul&#39;s thought all naked will bestow it&#34;,\n &#39; Till whatsoever star that guides my moving&#39;,\n &#39; Points on me graciously with fair aspect&#39;,\n &#39; And puts apparel on my tattered loving&#39;,\n &#39; To show me worthy of thy sweet respect&#39;,\n &#39; Then may I dare to boast how I do love thee&#39;,\n &#39; Till then not show my head where thou mayst prove me&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39; 27&#39;,\n &#39; Weary with toil I haste me to my bed&#39;,\n &#39; The dear respose for limbs with travel tired&#39;,\n &#39; But then begins a journey in my head&#39;,\n &#34; To work my mind when body&#39;s work&#39;s expired&#34;,\n &#39; For then my thoughts from far where I abide&#39;,\n &#39; Intend a zealous pilgrimage to thee&#39;,\n &#39; And keep my drooping eyelids open wide&#39;,\n &#39; Looking on darkness which the blind do see&#39;,\n &#34; Save that my soul&#39;s imaginary sight&#34;,\n &#39; Presents thy shadow to my sightless view&#39;,\n &#39; Which like a jewel hung in ghastly night&#39;,\n &#39; Makes black night beauteous and her old face new&#39;,\n &#39; Lo thus by day my limbs by night my mind&#39;,\n &#39; For thee and for my self no quiet find&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39; 28&#39;,\n &#39; How can I then return in happy plight&#39;,\n &#39; That am debarred the benefit of rest&#39;,\n &#34; When day&#39;s oppression is not eased by night&#34;,\n &#39; But day by night and night by day oppressed&#39;,\n &#34; And each though enemies to either&#39;s reign&#34;,\n &#39; Do in consent shake hands to torture me&#39;,\n &#39; The one by toil the other to complain&#39;,\n &#39; How far I toil still farther off from thee&#39;,\n &#39; I tell the day to please him thou art bright&#39;,\n &#39; And dost him grace when clouds do blot the heaven&#39;,\n &#39; So flatter I the swart complexioned night&#39;,\n &#34; When sparkling stars twire not thou gild&#39;st the even&#34;,\n &#39; But day doth daily draw my sorrows longer&#39;,\n &#34; And night doth nightly make grief&#39;s length seem stronger&#34;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39; 29&#39;,\n &#34; When in disgrace with Fortune and men&#39;s eyes&#34;,\n &#39; I all alone beweep my outcast state&#39;,\n &#39; And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries&#39;,\n &#39; And look upon my self and curse my fate&#39;,\n &#39; Wishing me like to one more rich in hope&#39;,\n &#39; Featured like him like him with friends possessed&#39;,\n &#34; Desiring this man&#39;s art and that man&#39;s scope&#34;,\n &#39; With what I most enjoy contented least&#39;,\n &#39; Yet in these thoughts my self almost despising&#39;,\n &#39; Haply I think on thee and then my state&#39;,\n &#39; Like to the lark at break of day arising&#39;,\n &#34; From sullen earth sings hymns at heaven&#39;s gate&#34;,\n &#39; For thy sweet love remembered such wealth brings&#39;,\n &#39; That then I scorn to change my state with kings&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39; 30&#39;,\n &#39; When to the sessions of sweet silent thought&#39;,\n &#39; I summon up remembrance of things past&#39;,\n &#39; I sigh the lack of many a thing I sought&#39;,\n &#34; And with old woes new wail my dear time&#39;s waste&#34;,\n &#39; Then can I drown an eye unused to flow&#39;,\n &#34; For precious friends hid in death&#39;s dateless night&#34;,\n &#34; And weep afresh love&#39;s long since cancelled woe&#34;,\n &#34; And moan th&#39; expense of many a vanished sight&#34;,\n &#39; Then can I grieve at grievances foregone&#39;,\n &#34; And heavily from woe to woe tell o&#39;er&#34;,\n &#39; The sad account of fore bemoaned moan&#39;,\n &#39; Which I new pay as if not paid before&#39;,\n &#39; But if the while I think on thee dear friend&#39;,\n &#39; All losses are restored and sorrows end&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39; 31&#39;,\n &#39; Thy bosom is endeared with all hearts&#39;,\n &#39; Which I by lacking have supposed dead&#39;,\n &#34; And there reigns love and all love&#39;s loving parts&#34;,\n &#39; And all those friends which I thought buried&#39;,\n &#39; How many a holy and obsequious tear&#39;,\n &#34; Hath dear religious love stol&#39;n from mine eye&#34;,\n &#39; As interest of the dead which now appear&#39;,\n &#39; But things removed that hidden in thee lie&#39;,\n &#39; Thou art the grave where buried love doth live&#39;,\n &#39; Hung with the trophies of my lovers gone&#39;,\n &#39; Who all their parts of me to thee did give&#39;,\n &#39; That due of many now is thine alone&#39;,\n &#39; Their images I loved I view in thee&#39;,\n &#39; And thou all they hast all the all of me&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39; 32&#39;,\n &#39; If thou survive my well contented day&#39;,\n &#39; When that churl death my bones with dust shall cover&#39;,\n &#39; And shalt by fortune once more re survey&#39;,\n &#39; These poor rude lines of thy deceased lover&#39;,\n &#34; Compare them with the bett&#39;ring of the time&#34;,\n &#39; And though they be outstripped by every pen&#39;,\n &#39; Reserve them for my love not for their rhyme&#39;,\n &#39; Exceeded by the height of happier men&#39;,\n &#39; O then vouchsafe me but this loving thought&#39;,\n &#34; &#39;Had my friend&#39;s Muse grown with this growing age&#34;,\n &#39; A dearer birth than this his love had brought&#39;,\n &#39; To march in ranks of better equipage&#39;,\n &#39; But since he died and poets better prove&#39;,\n &#34; Theirs for their style I&#39;ll read his for his love&#39;&#34;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39; 33&#39;,\n &#39; Full many a glorious morning have I seen&#39;,\n &#39; Flatter the mountain tops with sovereign eye&#39;,\n &#39; Kissing with golden face the meadows green&#39;,\n &#39; Gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy&#39;,\n &#39; Anon permit the basest clouds to ride&#39;,\n &#39; With ugly rack on his celestial face&#39;,\n &#39; And from the forlorn world his visage hide&#39;,\n &#39; Stealing unseen to west with this disgrace&#39;,\n &#39; Even so my sun one early morn did shine&#39;,\n &#39; With all triumphant splendour on my brow&#39;,\n &#39; But out alack he was but one hour mine&#39;,\n &#39; The region cloud hath masked him from me now&#39;,\n &#39; Yet him for this my love no whit disdaineth&#39;,\n &#34; Suns of the world may stain when heaven&#39;s sun staineth&#34;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39; 34&#39;,\n &#39; Why didst thou promise such a beauteous day&#39;,\n &#39; And make me travel forth without my cloak&#39;,\n &#34; To let base clouds o&#39;ertake me in my way&#34;,\n &#34; Hiding thy brav&#39;ry in their rotten smoke&#34;,\n &#34; &#39;Tis not enough that through the cloud thou break&#34;,\n &#39; To dry the rain on my storm beaten face&#39;,\n &#39; For no man well of such a salve can speak&#39;,\n &#39; That heals the wound and cures not the disgrace&#39;,\n &#39; Nor can thy shame give physic to my grief&#39;,\n &#39; Though thou repent yet I have still the loss&#39;,\n &#34; Th&#39; offender&#39;s sorrow lends but weak relief&#34;,\n &#34; To him that bears the strong offence&#39;s cross&#34;,\n &#39; Ah but those tears are pearl which thy love sheds&#39;,\n &#39; And they are rich and ransom all ill deeds&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39; 35&#39;,\n &#39; No more be grieved at that which thou hast done&#39;,\n &#39; Roses have thorns and silver fountains mud&#39;,\n &#39; Clouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun&#39;,\n &#39; And loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud&#39;,\n &#39; All men make faults and even I in this&#39;,\n &#39; Authorizing thy trespass with compare&#39;,\n &#39; My self corrupting salving thy amiss&#39;,\n &#39; Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are&#39;,\n &#39; For to thy sensual fault I bring in sense&#39;,\n &#39; Thy adverse party is thy advocate&#39;,\n &#34; And &#39;gainst my self a lawful plea commence&#34;,\n &#39; Such civil war is in my love and hate&#39;,\n &#39; That I an accessary needs must be&#39;,\n &#39; To that sweet thief which sourly robs from me&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39; 36&#39;,\n &#39; Let me confess that we two must be twain&#39;,\n &#39; Although our undivided loves are one&#39;,\n &#39; So shall those blots that do with me remain&#39;,\n &#39; Without thy help by me be borne alone&#39;,\n &#39; In our two loves there is but one respect&#39;,\n &#39; Though in our lives a separable spite&#39;,\n &#34; Which though it alter not love&#39;s sole effect&#34;,\n &#34; Yet doth it steal sweet hours from love&#39;s delight&#34;,\n &#39; I may not evermore acknowledge thee&#39;,\n &#39; Lest my bewailed guilt should do thee shame&#39;,\n &#39; Nor thou with public kindness honour me&#39;,\n &#39; Unless thou take that honour from thy name&#39;,\n &#39; But do not so I love thee in such sort&#39;,\n &#39; As thou being mine mine is thy good report&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39; 37&#39;,\n &#39; As a decrepit father takes delight&#39;,\n &#39; To see his active child do deeds of youth&#39;,\n &#34; So I made lame by Fortune&#39;s dearest spite&#34;,\n &#39; Take all my comfort of thy worth and truth&#39;,\n &#39; For whether beauty birth or wealth or wit&#39;,\n &#39; Or any of these all or all or more&#39;,\n &#39; Entitled in thy parts do crowned sit&#39;,\n &#39; I make my love engrafted to this store&#39;,\n &#39; So then I am not lame poor nor despised&#39;,\n &#39; Whilst that this shadow doth such substance give&#39;,\n &#39; That I in thy abundance am sufficed&#39;,\n &#39; And by a part of all thy glory live&#39;,\n &#39; Look what is best that best I wish in thee&#39;,\n &#39; This wish I have then ten times happy me&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39; 38&#39;,\n &#39; How can my muse want subject to invent&#39;,\n &#34; While thou dost breathe that pour&#39;st into my verse&#34;,\n &#39; Thine own sweet argument too excellent&#39;,\n &#39; For every vulgar paper to rehearse&#39;,\n &#39; O give thy self the thanks if aught in me&#39;,\n &#39; Worthy perusal stand against thy sight&#39;,\n &#34; For who&#39;s so dumb that cannot write to thee&#34;,\n &#39; When thou thy self dost give invention light&#39;,\n &#39; Be thou the tenth Muse ten times more in worth&#39;,\n &#39; Than those old nine which rhymers invocate&#39;,\n &#39; And he that calls on thee let him bring forth&#39;,\n &#39; Eternal numbers to outlive long date&#39;,\n &#39; If my slight muse do please these curious days&#39;,\n &#39; The pain be mine but thine shall be the praise&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39; 39&#39;,\n &#39; O how thy worth with manners may I sing&#39;,\n &#39; When thou art all the better part of me&#39;,\n &#39; What can mine own praise to mine own self bring&#39;,\n &#34; And what is&#39;t but mine own when I praise thee&#34;,\n &#39; Even for this let us divided live&#39;,\n &#39; And our dear love lose name of single one&#39;,\n &#39; That by this separation I may give&#39;,\n &#34; That due to thee which thou deserv&#39;st alone&#34;,\n &#39; O absence what a torment wouldst thou prove&#39;,\n &#39; Were it not thy sour leisure gave sweet leave&#39;,\n &#39; To entertain the time with thoughts of love&#39;,\n &#39; Which time and thoughts so sweetly doth deceive&#39;,\n &#39; And that thou teachest how to make one twain&#39;,\n &#39; By praising him here who doth hence remain&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39; 40&#39;,\n &#39; Take all my loves my love yea take them all&#39;,\n &#39; What hast thou then more than thou hadst before&#39;,\n &#39; No love my love that thou mayst true love call&#39;,\n &#39; All mine was thine before thou hadst this more&#39;,\n &#39; Then if for my love thou my love receivest&#39;,\n &#39; I cannot blame thee for my love thou usest&#39;,\n &#39; But yet be blamed if thou thy self deceivest&#39;,\n &#39; By wilful taste of what thy self refusest&#39;,\n &#39; I do forgive thy robbery gentle thief&#39;,\n &#39; Although thou steal thee all my poverty&#39;,\n &#39; And yet love knows it is a greater grief&#39;,\n &#34; To bear greater wrong than hate&#39;s known injury&#34;,\n &#39; Lascivious grace in whom all ill well shows&#39;,\n &#39; Kill me with spites yet we must not be foes&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39; 41&#39;,\n &#39; Those pretty wrongs that liberty commits&#39;,\n &#39; When I am sometime absent from thy heart&#39;,\n &#39; Thy beauty and thy years full well befits&#39;,\n &#39; For still temptation follows where thou art&#39;,\n &#39; Gentle thou art and therefore to be won&#39;,\n &#39; Beauteous thou art therefore to be assailed&#39;,\n &#34; And when a woman woos what woman&#39;s son&#34;,\n &#39; Will sourly leave her till he have prevailed&#39;,\n &#39; Ay me but yet thou mightst my seat forbear&#39;,\n &#39; And chide thy beauty and thy straying youth&#39;,\n &#39; Who lead thee in their riot even there&#39;,\n &#39; Where thou art forced to break a twofold truth&#39;,\n &#39; Hers by thy beauty tempting her to thee&#39;,\n &#39; Thine by thy beauty being false to me&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39; 42&#39;,\n &#39; That thou hast her it is not all my grief&#39;,\n &#39; And yet it may be said I loved her dearly&#39;,\n &#39; That she hath thee is of my wailing chief&#39;,\n &#39; A loss in love that touches me more nearly&#39;,\n &#39; Loving offenders thus I will excuse ye&#39;,\n &#34; Thou dost love her because thou know&#39;st I love her&#34;,\n &#39; And for my sake even so doth she abuse me&#39;,\n &#34; Suff&#39;ring my friend for my sake to approve her&#34;,\n &#34; If I lose thee my loss is my love&#39;s gain&#34;,\n &#39; And losing her my friend hath found that loss&#39;,\n &#39; Both find each other and I lose both twain&#39;,\n &#39; And both for my sake lay on me this cross&#39;,\n &#34; But here&#39;s the joy my friend and I are one&#34;,\n &#39; Sweet flattery then she loves but me alone&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39; 43&#39;,\n &#39; When most I wink then do mine eyes best see&#39;,\n &#39; For all the day they view things unrespected&#39;,\n &#39; But when I sleep in dreams they look on thee&#39;,\n &#39; And darkly bright are bright in dark directed&#39;,\n &#39; Then thou whose shadow shadows doth make bright&#39;,\n &#34; How would thy shadow&#39;s form form happy show&#34;,\n &#39; To the clear day with thy much clearer light&#39;,\n &#39; When to unseeing eyes thy shade shines so&#39;,\n &#39; How would I say mine eyes be blessed made&#39;,\n &#39; By looking on thee in the living day&#39;,\n &#39; When in dead night thy fair imperfect shade&#39;,\n &#39; Through heavy sleep on sightless eyes doth stay&#39;,\n &#39; All days are nights to see till I see thee&#39;,\n &#39; And nights bright days when dreams do show thee me&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39; 44&#39;,\n &#39; If the dull substance of my flesh were thought&#39;,\n &#39; Injurious distance should not stop my way&#39;,\n &#39; For then despite of space I would be brought&#39;,\n &#39; From limits far remote where thou dost stay&#39;,\n &#39; No matter then although my foot did stand&#39;,\n &#39; Upon the farthest earth removed from thee&#39;,\n &#39; For nimble thought can jump both sea and land&#39;,\n &#39; As soon as think the place where he would be&#39;,\n &#39; But ah thought kills me that I am not thought&#39;,\n &#39; To leap large lengths of miles when thou art gone&#39;,\n &#39; But that so much of earth and water wrought&#39;,\n &#34; I must attend time&#39;s leisure with my moan&#34;,\n &#39; Receiving nought by elements so slow&#39;,\n &#34; But heavy tears badges of either&#39;s woe&#34;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39; 45&#39;,\n &#39; The other two slight air and purging fire&#39;,\n &#39; Are both with thee wherever I abide&#39;,\n &#39; The first my thought the other my desire&#39;,\n &#39; These present absent with swift motion slide&#39;,\n &#39; For when these quicker elements are gone&#39;,\n &#39; In tender embassy of love to thee&#39;,\n &#39; My life being made of four with two alone&#39;,\n &#39; Sinks down to death oppressed with melancholy&#39;,\n &#34; Until life&#39;s composition be recured&#34;,\n &#39; By those swift messengers returned from thee&#39;,\n &#39; Who even but now come back again assured&#39;,\n &#39; Of thy fair health recounting it to me&#39;,\n &#39; This told I joy but then no longer glad&#39;,\n &#39; I send them back again and straight grow sad&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39; 46&#39;,\n &#39; Mine eye and heart are at a mortal war&#39;,\n &#39; How to divide the conquest of thy sight&#39;,\n &#34; Mine eye my heart thy picture&#39;s sight would bar&#34;,\n &#39; My heart mine eye the freedom of that right&#39;,\n &#39; My heart doth plead that thou in him dost lie&#39;,\n &#39; A closet never pierced with crystal eyes&#39;,\n &#39; But the defendant doth that plea deny&#39;,\n &#39; And says in him thy fair appearance lies&#39;,\n &#39; To side this title is impanelled&#39;,\n &#39; A quest of thoughts all tenants to the heart&#39;,\n &#39; And by their verdict is determined&#39;,\n &#34; The clear eye&#39;s moiety and the dear heart&#39;s part&#34;,\n &#34; As thus mine eye&#39;s due is thy outward part&#34;,\n &#34; And my heart&#39;s right thy inward love of heart&#34;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39; 47&#39;,\n &#39; Betwixt mine eye and heart a league is took&#39;,\n &#39; And each doth good turns now unto the other&#39;,\n &#39; When that mine eye is famished for a look&#39;,\n &#39; Or heart in love with sighs himself doth smother&#39;,\n &#34; With my love&#39;s picture then my eye doth feast&#34;,\n &#39; And to the painted banquet bids my heart&#39;,\n &#34; Another time mine eye is my heart&#39;s guest&#34;,\n &#39; And in his thoughts of love doth share a part&#39;,\n &#39; So either by thy picture or my love&#39;,\n &#39; Thy self away art present still with me&#39;,\n &#39; For thou not farther than my thoughts canst move&#39;,\n &#39; And I am still with them and they with thee&#39;,\n &#39; Or if they sleep thy picture in my sight&#39;,\n &#34; Awakes my heart to heart&#39;s and eye&#39;s delight&#34;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39; 48&#39;,\n &#39; How careful was I when I took my way&#39;,\n &#39; Each trifle under truest bars to thrust&#39;,\n &#39; That to my use it might unused stay&#39;,\n &#39; From hands of falsehood in sure wards of trust&#39;,\n &#39; But thou to whom my jewels trifles are&#39;,\n &#39; Most worthy comfort now my greatest grief&#39;,\n &#39; Thou best of dearest and mine only care&#39;,\n &#39; Art left the prey of every vulgar thief&#39;,\n &#39; Thee have I not locked up in any chest&#39;,\n &#39; Save where thou art not though I feel thou art&#39;,\n &#39; Within the gentle closure of my breast&#39;,\n &#39; From whence at pleasure thou mayst come and part&#39;,\n &#34; And even thence thou wilt be stol&#39;n I fear&#34;,\n &#39; For truth proves thievish for a prize so dear&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39; 49&#39;,\n &#39; Against that time if ever that time come&#39;,\n &#39; When I shall see thee frown on my defects&#39;,\n &#39; When as thy love

&#39;&#39;,\n &#39;THE SONNETS&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;by William Shakespeare&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39; 1&#39;,\n &#39; From fairest creatures we desire increase&#39;,\n &#34; That thereby beauty&#39;s rose might never die&#34;,\n &#39; But as the riper should by time decease&#39;,\n &#39; His tender heir might bear his memory&#39;,\n &#39; But thou contracted to thine own bright eyes&#39;,\n &#34; Feed&#39;st thy light&#39;s flame with self substantial fuel&#34;,\n &#39; Making a famine where abundance lies&#39;,\n &#39; Thy self thy foe to thy sweet self too cruel&#39;,\n &#34; Thou that art now the world&#39;s fresh ornament&#34;,\n &#39; And only herald to the gaudy spring&#39;,\n &#39; Within thine own bud buriest thy content&#39;,\n &#34; And tender churl mak&#39;st waste in niggarding&#34;,\n &#39; Pity the world or else this glutton be&#39;,\n &#34; To eat the world&#39;s due by the grave and thee&#34;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39; 2&#39;,\n &#39; When forty winters shall besiege thy brow&#39;,\n &#34; And dig deep trenches in thy beauty&#39;s field&#34;,\n &#34; Thy youth&#39;s proud livery so gazed on now&#34;,\n &#39; Will be a tattered weed of small worth held&#39;,\n &#39; Then being asked where all thy beauty lies&#39;,\n &#39; Where all the treasure of thy lusty days&#39;,\n &#39; To say within thine own deep sunken eyes&#39;,\n &#39; Were an all eating shame and thriftless praise&#39;,\n &#34; How much more praise deserved thy beauty&#39;s use&#34;,\n &#34; If thou couldst answer &#39;This fair child of mine&#34;,\n &#34; Shall sum my count and make my old excuse&#39;&#34;,\n &#39; Proving his beauty by succession thine&#39;,\n &#39; This were to be new made when thou art old&#39;,\n &#34; And see thy blood warm when thou feel&#39;st it cold&#34;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39; 3&#39;,\n &#39; Look in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest&#39;,\n &#39; Now is the time that face should form another&#39;,\n &#39; Whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest&#39;,\n &#39; Thou dost beguile the world unbless some mother&#39;,\n &#39; For where is she so fair whose uneared womb&#39;,\n &#39; Disdains the tillage of thy husbandry&#39;,\n &#39; Or who is he so fond will be the tomb&#39;,\n &#39; Of his self love to stop posterity&#39;,\n &#34; Thou art thy mother&#39;s glass and she in thee&#34;,\n &#39; Calls back the lovely April of her prime&#39;,\n &#39; So thou through windows of thine age shalt see&#39;,\n &#39; Despite of wrinkles this thy golden time&#39;,\n &#39; But if thou live remembered not to be&#39;,\n &#39; Die single and thine image dies with thee&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39; 4&#39;,\n &#39; Unthrifty loveliness why dost thou spend&#39;,\n &#34; Upon thy self thy beauty&#39;s legacy&#34;,\n &#34; Nature&#39;s bequest gives nothing but doth lend&#34;,\n &#39; And being frank she lends to those are free&#39;,\n &#39; Then beauteous niggard why dost thou abuse&#39;,\n &#39; The bounteous largess given thee to give&#39;,\n &#39; Profitless usurer why dost thou use&#39;,\n &#39; So great a sum of sums yet canst not live&#39;,\n &#39; For having traffic with thy self alone&#39;,\n &#39; Thou of thy self thy sweet self dost deceive&#39;,\n &#39; Then how when nature calls thee to be gone&#39;,\n &#39; What acceptable audit canst thou leave&#39;,\n &#39; Thy unused beauty must be tombed with thee&#39;,\n &#34; Which used lives th&#39; executor to be&#34;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39; 5&#39;,\n &#39; Those hours that with gentle work did frame&#39;,\n &#39; The lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell&#39;,\n &#39; Will play the tyrants to the very same&#39;,\n &#39; And that unfair which fairly doth excel&#39;,\n &#39; For never resting time leads summer on&#39;,\n &#39; To hideous winter and confounds him there&#39;,\n &#39; Sap checked with frost and lusty leaves quite gone&#39;,\n &#34; Beauty o&#39;er snowed and bareness every where&#34;,\n &#34; Then were not summer&#39;s distillation left&#34;,\n &#39; A liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass&#39;,\n &#34; Beauty&#39;s effect with beauty were bereft&#34;,\n &#39; Nor it nor no remembrance what it was&#39;,\n &#39; But flowers distilled though they with winter meet&#39;,\n &#39; Leese but their show their substance still lives sweet&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39; 6&#39;,\n &#34; Then let not winter&#39;s ragged hand deface&#34;,\n &#39; In thee thy summer ere thou be distilled&#39;,\n &#39; Make sweet some vial treasure thou some place&#39;,\n &#34; With beauty&#39;s treasure ere it be self killed&#34;,\n &#39; That use is not forbidden usury&#39;,\n &#39; Which happies those that pay the willing loan&#39;,\n &#34; That&#39;s for thy self to breed another thee&#34;,\n &#39; Or ten times happier be it ten for one&#39;,\n &#39; Ten times thy self were happier than thou art&#39;,\n &#39; If ten of thine ten times refigured thee&#39;,\n &#39; Then what could death do if thou shouldst depart&#39;,\n &#39; Leaving thee living in posterity&#39;,\n &#39; Be not self willed for thou art much too fair&#39;,\n &#34; To be death&#39;s conquest and make worms thine heir&#34;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39; 7&#39;,\n &#39; Lo in the orient when the gracious light&#39;,\n &#39; Lifts up his burning head each under eye&#39;,\n &#39; Doth homage to his new appearing sight&#39;,\n &#39; Serving with looks his sacred majesty&#39;,\n &#39; And having climbed the steep up heavenly hill&#39;,\n &#39; Resembling strong youth in his middle age&#39;,\n &#39; Yet mortal looks adore his beauty still&#39;,\n &#39; Attending on his golden pilgrimage&#39;,\n &#39; But when from highmost pitch with weary car&#39;,\n &#39; Like feeble age he reeleth from the day&#39;,\n &#39; The eyes fore duteous now converted are&#39;,\n &#39; From his low tract and look another way&#39;,\n &#39; So thou thy self out going in thy noon&#39;,\n &#39; Unlooked on diest unless thou get a son&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39; 8&#39;,\n &#34; Music to hear why hear&#39;st thou music sadly&#34;,\n &#39; Sweets with sweets war not joy delights in joy&#39;,\n &#34; Why lov&#39;st thou that which thou receiv&#39;st not gladly&#34;,\n &#34; Or else receiv&#39;st with pleasure thine annoy&#34;,\n &#39; If the true concord of well tuned sounds&#39;,\n &#39; By unions married do offend thine ear&#39;,\n &#39; They do but sweetly chide thee who confounds&#39;,\n &#39; In singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear&#39;,\n &#39; Mark how one string sweet husband to another&#39;,\n &#39; Strikes each in each by mutual ordering&#39;,\n &#39; Resembling sire and child and happy mother&#39;,\n &#39; Who all in one one pleasing note do sing&#39;,\n &#39; Whose speechless song being many seeming one&#39;,\n &#34; Sings this to thee &#39;Thou single wilt prove none&#39;&#34;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39; 9&#39;,\n &#34; Is it for fear to wet a widow&#39;s eye&#34;,\n &#34; That thou consum&#39;st thy self in single life&#34;,\n &#39; Ah if thou issueless shalt hap to die&#39;,\n &#39; The world will wail thee like a makeless wife&#39;,\n &#39; The world will be thy widow and still weep&#39;,\n &#39; That thou no form of thee hast left behind&#39;,\n &#39; When every private widow well may keep&#39;,\n &#34; By children&#39;s eyes her husband&#39;s shape in mind&#34;,\n &#39; Look what an unthrift in the world doth spend&#39;,\n &#39; Shifts but his place for still the world enjoys it&#39;,\n &#34; But beauty&#39;s waste hath in the world an end&#34;,\n &#39; And kept unused the user so destroys it&#39;,\n &#39; No love toward others in that bosom sits&#39;,\n &#34; That on himself such murd&#39;rous shame commits&#34;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39; 10&#39;,\n &#34; For shame deny that thou bear&#39;st love to any&#34;,\n &#39; Who for thy self art so unprovident&#39;,\n &#39; Grant if thou wilt thou art beloved of many&#39;,\n &#34; But that thou none lov&#39;st is most evident&#34;,\n &#34; For thou art so possessed with murd&#39;rous hate&#34;,\n &#34; That &#39;gainst thy self thou stick&#39;st not to conspire&#34;,\n &#39; Seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate&#39;,\n &#39; Which to repair should be thy chief desire&#39;,\n &#39; O change thy thought that I may change my mind&#39;,\n &#39; Shall hate be fairer lodged than gentle love&#39;,\n &#39; Be as thy presence is gracious and kind&#39;,\n &#39; Or to thy self at least kind hearted prove&#39;,\n &#39; Make thee another self for love of me&#39;,\n &#39; That beauty still may live in thine or thee&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39; 11&#39;,\n &#34; As fast as thou shalt wane so fast thou grow&#39;st&#34;,\n &#39; In one of thine from that which thou departest&#39;,\n &#34; And that fresh blood which youngly thou bestow&#39;st&#34;,\n &#39; Thou mayst call thine when thou from youth convertest&#39;,\n &#39; Herein lives wisdom beauty and increase&#39;,\n &#39; Without this folly age and cold decay&#39;,\n &#39; If all were minded so the times should cease&#39;,\n &#39; And threescore year would make the world away&#39;,\n &#39; Let those whom nature hath not made for store&#39;,\n &#39; Harsh featureless and rude barrenly perish&#39;,\n &#39; Look whom she best endowed she gave thee more&#39;,\n &#39; Which bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish&#39;,\n &#39; She carved thee for her seal and meant thereby&#39;,\n &#39; Thou shouldst print more not let that copy die&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39; 12&#39;,\n &#39; When I do count the clock that tells the time&#39;,\n &#39; And see the brave day sunk in hideous night&#39;,\n &#39; When I behold the violet past prime&#39;,\n &#34; And sable curls all silvered o&#39;er with white&#34;,\n &#39; When lofty trees I see barren of leaves&#39;,\n &#39; Which erst from heat did canopy the herd&#39;,\n &#34; And summer&#39;s green all girded up in sheaves&#34;,\n &#39; Borne on the bier with white and bristly beard&#39;,\n &#39; Then of thy beauty do I question make&#39;,\n &#39; That thou among the wastes of time must go&#39;,\n &#39; Since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake&#39;,\n &#39; And die as fast as they see others grow&#39;,\n &#34; And nothing &#39;gainst Time&#39;s scythe can make defence&#34;,\n &#39; Save breed to brave him when he takes thee hence&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39; 13&#39;,\n &#39; O that you were your self but love you are&#39;,\n &#39; No longer yours than you your self here live&#39;,\n &#39; Against this coming end you should prepare&#39;,\n &#39; And your sweet semblance to some other give&#39;,\n &#39; So should that beauty which you hold in lease&#39;,\n &#39; Find no determination then you were&#39;,\n &#34; Your self again after your self&#39;s decease&#34;,\n &#39; When your sweet issue your sweet form should bear&#39;,\n &#39; Who lets so fair a house fall to decay&#39;,\n &#39; Which husbandry in honour might uphold&#39;,\n &#34; Against the stormy gusts of winter&#39;s day&#34;,\n &#34; And barren rage of death&#39;s eternal cold&#34;,\n &#39; O none but unthrifts dear my love you know&#39;,\n &#39; You had a father let your son say so&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39; 14&#39;,\n &#39; Not from the stars do I my judgement pluck&#39;,\n &#39; And yet methinks I have astronomy&#39;,\n &#39; But not to tell of good or evil luck&#39;,\n &#34; Of plagues of dearths or seasons&#39; quality&#34;,\n &#39; Nor can I fortune to brief minutes tell&#39;,\n &#39; Pointing to each his thunder rain and wind&#39;,\n &#39; Or say with princes if it shall go well&#39;,\n &#39; By oft predict that I in heaven find&#39;,\n &#39; But from thine eyes my knowledge I derive&#39;,\n &#39; And constant stars in them I read such art&#39;,\n &#39; As truth and beauty shall together thrive&#39;,\n &#39; If from thy self to store thou wouldst convert&#39;,\n &#39; Or else of thee this I prognosticate&#39;,\n &#34; Thy end is truth&#39;s and beauty&#39;s doom and date&#34;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39; 15&#39;,\n &#39; When I consider every thing that grows&#39;,\n &#39; Holds in perfection but a little moment&#39;,\n &#39; That this huge stage presenteth nought but shows&#39;,\n &#39; Whereon the stars in secret influence comment&#39;,\n &#39; When I perceive that men as plants increase&#39;,\n &#39; Cheered and checked even by the self same sky&#39;,\n &#39; Vaunt in their youthful sap at height decrease&#39;,\n &#39; And wear their brave state out of memory&#39;,\n &#39; Then the conceit of this inconstant stay&#39;,\n &#39; Sets you most rich in youth before my sight&#39;,\n &#39; Where wasteful time debateth with decay&#39;,\n &#39; To change your day of youth to sullied night&#39;,\n &#39; And all in war with Time for love of you&#39;,\n &#39; As he takes from you I engraft you new&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39; 16&#39;,\n &#39; But wherefore do not you a mightier way&#39;,\n &#39; Make war upon this bloody tyrant Time&#39;,\n &#39; And fortify your self in your decay&#39;,\n &#39; With means more blessed than my barren rhyme&#39;,\n &#39; Now stand you on the top of happy hours&#39;,\n &#39; And many maiden gardens yet unset&#39;,\n &#39; With virtuous wish would bear you living flowers&#39;,\n &#39; Much liker than your painted counterfeit&#39;,\n &#39; So should the lines of life that life repair&#39;,\n &#34; Which this Time&#39;s pencil or my pupil pen&#34;,\n &#39; Neither in inward worth nor outward fair&#39;,\n &#39; Can make you live your self in eyes of men&#39;,\n &#39; To give away your self keeps your self still&#39;,\n &#39; And you must live drawn by your own sweet skill&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39; 17&#39;,\n &#39; Who will believe my verse in time to come&#39;,\n &#39; If it were filled with your most high deserts&#39;,\n &#39; Though yet heaven knows it is but as a tomb&#39;,\n &#39; Which hides your life and shows not half your parts&#39;,\n &#39; If I could write the beauty of your eyes&#39;,\n &#39; And in fresh numbers number all your graces&#39;,\n &#39; The age to come would say this poet lies&#39;,\n &#34; Such heavenly touches ne&#39;er touched earthly faces&#34;,\n &#39; So should my papers yellowed with their age&#39;,\n &#39; Be scorned like old men of less truth than tongue&#39;,\n &#34; And your true rights be termed a poet&#39;s rage&#34;,\n &#39; And stretched metre of an antique song&#39;,\n &#39; But were some child of yours alive that time&#39;,\n &#39; You should live twice in it and in my rhyme&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39; 18&#39;,\n &#34; Shall I compare thee to a summer&#39;s day&#34;,\n &#39; Thou art more lovely and more temperate&#39;,\n &#39; Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May&#39;,\n &#34; And summer&#39;s lease hath all too short a date&#34;,\n &#39; Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines&#39;,\n &#39; And often is his gold complexion dimmed&#39;,\n &#39; And every fair from fair sometime declines&#39;,\n &#34; By chance or nature&#39;s changing course untrimmed&#34;,\n &#39; But thy eternal summer shall not fade&#39;,\n &#34; Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow&#39;st&#34;,\n &#34; Nor shall death brag thou wand&#39;rest in his shade&#34;,\n &#34; When in eternal lines to time thou grow&#39;st&#34;,\n &#39; So long as men can breathe or eyes can see&#39;,\n &#39; So long lives this and this gives life to thee&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39; 19&#39;,\n &#34; Devouring Time blunt thou the lion&#39;s paws&#34;,\n &#39; And make the earth devour her own sweet brood&#39;,\n &#34; Pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tiger&#39;s jaws&#34;,\n &#39; And burn the long lived phoenix in her blood&#39;,\n &#34; Make glad and sorry seasons as thou fleet&#39;st&#34;,\n &#34; And do whate&#39;er thou wilt swift footed Time&#34;,\n &#39; To the wide world and all her fading sweets&#39;,\n &#39; But I forbid thee one most heinous crime&#39;,\n &#34; O carve not with thy hours my love&#39;s fair brow&#34;,\n &#39; Nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen&#39;,\n &#39; Him in thy course untainted do allow&#39;,\n &#34; For beauty&#39;s pattern to succeeding men&#34;,\n &#39; Yet do thy worst old Time despite thy wrong&#39;,\n &#39; My love shall in my verse ever live young&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39; 20&#39;,\n &#34; A woman&#39;s face with nature&#39;s own hand painted&#34;,\n &#39; Hast thou the master mistress of my passion&#39;,\n &#34; A woman&#39;s gentle heart but not acquainted&#34;,\n &#34; With shifting change as is false women&#39;s fashion&#34;,\n &#39; An eye more bright than theirs less false in rolling&#39;,\n &#39; Gilding the object whereupon it gazeth&#39;,\n &#39; A man in hue all hues in his controlling&#39;,\n &#34; Which steals men&#39;s eyes and women&#39;s souls amazeth&#34;,\n &#39; And for a woman wert thou first created&#39;,\n &#39; Till nature as she wrought thee fell a doting&#39;,\n &#39; And by addition me of thee defeated&#39;,\n &#39; By adding one thing to my purpose nothing&#39;,\n &#34; But since she pricked thee out for women&#39;s pleasure&#34;,\n &#34; Mine be thy love and thy love&#39;s use their treasure&#34;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39; 21&#39;,\n &#39; So is it not with me as with that muse&#39;,\n &#39; Stirred by a painted beauty to his verse&#39;,\n &#39; Who heaven it self for ornament doth use&#39;,\n &#39; And every fair with his fair doth rehearse&#39;,\n &#39; Making a couplement of proud compare&#39;,\n &#34; With sun and moon with earth and sea&#39;s rich gems&#34;,\n &#34; With April&#39;s first born flowers and all things rare&#34;,\n &#34; That heaven&#39;s air in this huge rondure hems&#34;,\n &#39; O let me true in love but truly write&#39;,\n &#39; And then believe me my love is as fair&#39;,\n &#34; As any mother&#39;s child though not so bright&#34;,\n &#34; As those gold candles fixed in heaven&#39;s air&#34;,\n &#39; Let them say more that like of hearsay well&#39;,\n &#39; I will not praise that purpose not to sell&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39; 22&#39;,\n &#39; My glass shall not persuade me I am old&#39;,\n &#39; So long as youth and thou are of one date&#39;,\n &#34; But when in thee time&#39;s furrows I behold&#34;,\n &#39; Then look I death my days should expiate&#39;,\n &#39; For all that beauty that doth cover thee&#39;,\n &#39; Is but the seemly raiment of my heart&#39;,\n &#39; Which in thy breast doth live as thine in me&#39;,\n &#39; How can I then be elder than thou art&#39;,\n &#39; O therefore love be of thyself so wary&#39;,\n &#39; As I not for my self but for thee will&#39;,\n &#39; Bearing thy heart which I will keep so chary&#39;,\n &#39; As tender nurse her babe from faring ill&#39;,\n &#39; Presume not on thy heart when mine is slain&#39;,\n &#34; Thou gav&#39;st me thine not to give back again&#34;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39; 23&#39;,\n &#39; As an unperfect actor on the stage&#39;,\n &#39; Who with his fear is put beside his part&#39;,\n &#39; Or some fierce thing replete with too much rage&#39;,\n &#34; Whose strength&#39;s abundance weakens his own heart&#34;,\n &#39; So I for fear of trust forget to say&#39;,\n &#34; The perfect ceremony of love&#39;s rite&#34;,\n &#34; And in mine own love&#39;s strength seem to decay&#34;,\n &#34; O&#39;ercharged with burthen of mine own love&#39;s might&#34;,\n &#39; O let my looks be then the eloquence&#39;,\n &#39; And dumb presagers of my speaking breast&#39;,\n &#39; Who plead for love and look for recompense&#39;,\n &#39; More than that tongue that more hath more expressed&#39;,\n &#39; O learn to read what silent love hath writ&#39;,\n &#34; To hear with eyes belongs to love&#39;s fine wit&#34;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39; 24&#39;,\n &#39; Mine eye hath played the painter and hath stelled&#39;,\n &#34; Thy beauty&#39;s form in table of my heart&#34;,\n &#34; My body is the frame wherein &#39;tis held&#34;,\n &#34; And perspective it is best painter&#39;s art&#34;,\n &#39; For through the painter must you see his skill&#39;,\n &#39; To find where your true image pictured lies&#39;,\n &#34; Which in my bosom&#39;s shop is hanging still&#34;,\n &#39; That hath his windows glazed with thine eyes&#39;,\n &#39; Now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done&#39;,\n &#39; Mine eyes have drawn thy shape and thine for me&#39;,\n &#39; Are windows to my breast where through the sun&#39;,\n &#39; Delights to peep to gaze therein on thee&#39;,\n &#39; Yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art&#39;,\n &#39; They draw but what they see know not the heart&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39; 25&#39;,\n &#39; Let those who are in favour with their stars&#39;,\n &#39; Of public honour and proud titles boast&#39;,\n &#39; Whilst I whom fortune of such triumph bars&#39;,\n &#39; Unlooked for joy in that I honour most&#39;,\n &#34; Great princes&#39; favourites their fair leaves spread&#34;,\n &#34; But as the marigold at the sun&#39;s eye&#34;,\n &#39; And in themselves their pride lies buried&#39;,\n &#39; For at a frown they in their glory die&#39;,\n &#39; The painful warrior famoused for fight&#39;,\n &#39; After a thousand victories once foiled&#39;,\n &#39; Is from the book of honour razed quite&#39;,\n &#39; And all the rest forgot for which he toiled&#39;,\n &#39; Then happy I that love and am beloved&#39;,\n &#39; Where I may not remove nor be removed&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39; 26&#39;,\n &#39; Lord of my love to whom in vassalage&#39;,\n &#39; Thy merit hath my duty strongly knit&#39;,\n &#39; To thee I send this written embassage&#39;,\n &#39; To witness duty not to show my wit&#39;,\n &#39; Duty so great which wit so poor as mine&#39;,\n &#39; May make seem bare in wanting words to show it&#39;,\n &#39; But that I hope some good conceit of thine&#39;,\n &#34; In thy soul&#39;s thought all naked will bestow it&#34;,\n &#39; Till whatsoever star that guides my moving&#39;,\n &#39; Points on me graciously with fair aspect&#39;,\n &#39; And puts apparel on my tattered loving&#39;,\n &#39; To show me worthy of thy sweet respect&#39;,\n &#39; Then may I dare to boast how I do love thee&#39;,\n &#39; Till then not show my head where thou mayst prove me&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39; 27&#39;,\n &#39; Weary with toil I haste me to my bed&#39;,\n &#39; The dear respose for limbs with travel tired&#39;,\n &#39; But then begins a journey in my head&#39;,\n &#34; To work my mind when body&#39;s work&#39;s expired&#34;,\n &#39; For then my thoughts from far where I abide&#39;,\n &#39; Intend a zealous pilgrimage to thee&#39;,\n &#39; And keep my drooping eyelids open wide&#39;,\n &#39; Looking on darkness which the blind do see&#39;,\n &#34; Save that my soul&#39;s imaginary sight&#34;,\n &#39; Presents thy shadow to my sightless view&#39;,\n &#39; Which like a jewel hung in ghastly night&#39;,\n &#39; Makes black night beauteous and her old face new&#39;,\n &#39; Lo thus by day my limbs by night my mind&#39;,\n &#39; For thee and for my self no quiet find&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39; 28&#39;,\n &#39; How can I then return in happy plight&#39;,\n &#39; That am debarred the benefit of rest&#39;,\n &#34; When day&#39;s oppression is not eased by night&#34;,\n &#39; But day by night and night by day oppressed&#39;,\n &#34; And each though enemies to either&#39;s reign&#34;,\n &#39; Do in consent shake hands to torture me&#39;,\n &#39; The one by toil the other to complain&#39;,\n &#39; How far I toil still farther off from thee&#39;,\n &#39; I tell the day to please him thou art bright&#39;,\n &#39; And dost him grace when clouds do blot the heaven&#39;,\n &#39; So flatter I the swart complexioned night&#39;,\n &#34; When sparkling stars twire not thou gild&#39;st the even&#34;,\n &#39; But day doth daily draw my sorrows longer&#39;,\n &#34; And night doth nightly make grief&#39;s length seem stronger&#34;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39; 29&#39;,\n &#34; When in disgrace with Fortune and men&#39;s eyes&#34;,\n &#39; I all alone beweep my outcast state&#39;,\n &#39; And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries&#39;,\n &#39; And look upon my self and curse my fate&#39;,\n &#39; Wishing me like to one more rich in hope&#39;,\n &#39; Featured like him like him with friends possessed&#39;,\n &#34; Desiring this man&#39;s art and that man&#39;s scope&#34;,\n &#39; With what I most enjoy contented least&#39;,\n &#39; Yet in these thoughts my self almost despising&#39;,\n &#39; Haply I think on thee and then my state&#39;,\n &#39; Like to the lark at break of day arising&#39;,\n &#34; From sullen earth sings hymns at heaven&#39;s gate&#34;,\n &#39; For thy sweet love remembered such wealth brings&#39;,\n &#39; That then I scorn to change my state with kings&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39; 30&#39;,\n &#39; When to the sessions of sweet silent thought&#39;,\n &#39; I summon up remembrance of things past&#39;,\n &#39; I sigh the lack of many a thing I sought&#39;,\n &#34; And with old woes new wail my dear time&#39;s waste&#34;,\n &#39; Then can I drown an eye unused to flow&#39;,\n &#34; For precious friends hid in death&#39;s dateless night&#34;,\n &#34; And weep afresh love&#39;s long since cancelled woe&#34;,\n &#34; And moan th&#39; expense of many a vanished sight&#34;,\n &#39; Then can I grieve at grievances foregone&#39;,\n &#34; And heavily from woe to woe tell o&#39;er&#34;,\n &#39; The sad account of fore bemoaned moan&#39;,\n &#39; Which I new pay as if not paid before&#39;,\n &#39; But if the while I think on thee dear friend&#39;,\n &#39; All losses are restored and sorrows end&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39; 31&#39;,\n &#39; Thy bosom is endeared with all hearts&#39;,\n &#39; Which I by lacking have supposed dead&#39;,\n &#34; And there reigns love and all love&#39;s loving parts&#34;,\n &#39; And all those friends which I thought buried&#39;,\n &#39; How many a holy and obsequious tear&#39;,\n &#34; Hath dear religious love stol&#39;n from mine eye&#34;,\n &#39; As interest of the dead which now appear&#39;,\n &#39; But things removed that hidden in thee lie&#39;,\n &#39; Thou art the grave where buried love doth live&#39;,\n &#39; Hung with the trophies of my lovers gone&#39;,\n &#39; Who all their parts of me to thee did give&#39;,\n &#39; That due of many now is thine alone&#39;,\n &#39; Their images I loved I view in thee&#39;,\n &#39; And thou all they hast all the all of me&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39; 32&#39;,\n &#39; If thou survive my well contented day&#39;,\n &#39; When that churl death my bones with dust shall cover&#39;,\n &#39; And shalt by fortune once more re survey&#39;,\n &#39; These poor rude lines of thy deceased lover&#39;,\n &#34; Compare them with the bett&#39;ring of the time&#34;,\n &#39; And though they be outstripped by every pen&#39;,\n &#39; Reserve them for my love not for their rhyme&#39;,\n &#39; Exceeded by the height of happier men&#39;,\n &#39; O then vouchsafe me but this loving thought&#39;,\n &#34; &#39;Had my friend&#39;s Muse grown with this growing age&#34;,\n &#39; A dearer birth than this his love had brought&#39;,\n &#39; To march in ranks of better equipage&#39;,\n &#39; But since he died and poets better prove&#39;,\n &#34; Theirs for their style I&#39;ll read his for his love&#39;&#34;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39; 33&#39;,\n &#39; Full many a glorious morning have I seen&#39;,\n &#39; Flatter the mountain tops with sovereign eye&#39;,\n &#39; Kissing with golden face the meadows green&#39;,\n &#39; Gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy&#39;,\n &#39; Anon permit the basest clouds to ride&#39;,\n &#39; With ugly rack on his celestial face&#39;,\n &#39; And from the forlorn world his visage hide&#39;,\n &#39; Stealing unseen to west with this disgrace&#39;,\n &#39; Even so my sun one early morn did shine&#39;,\n &#39; With all triumphant splendour on my brow&#39;,\n &#39; But out alack he was but one hour mine&#39;,\n &#39; The region cloud hath masked him from me now&#39;,\n &#39; Yet him for this my love no whit disdaineth&#39;,\n &#34; Suns of the world may stain when heaven&#39;s sun staineth&#34;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39; 34&#39;,\n &#39; Why didst thou promise such a beauteous day&#39;,\n &#39; And make me travel forth without my cloak&#39;,\n &#34; To let base clouds o&#39;ertake me in my way&#34;,\n &#34; Hiding thy brav&#39;ry in their rotten smoke&#34;,\n &#34; &#39;Tis not enough that through the cloud thou break&#34;,\n &#39; To dry the rain on my storm beaten face&#39;,\n &#39; For no man well of such a salve can speak&#39;,\n &#39; That heals the wound and cures not the disgrace&#39;,\n &#39; Nor can thy shame give physic to my grief&#39;,\n &#39; Though thou repent yet I have still the loss&#39;,\n &#34; Th&#39; offender&#39;s sorrow lends but weak relief&#34;,\n &#34; To him that bears the strong offence&#39;s cross&#34;,\n &#39; Ah but those tears are pearl which thy love sheds&#39;,\n &#39; And they are rich and ransom all ill deeds&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39; 35&#39;,\n &#39; No more be grieved at that which thou hast done&#39;,\n &#39; Roses have thorns and silver fountains mud&#39;,\n &#39; Clouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun&#39;,\n &#39; And loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud&#39;,\n &#39; All men make faults and even I in this&#39;,\n &#39; Authorizing thy trespass with compare&#39;,\n &#39; My self corrupting salving thy amiss&#39;,\n &#39; Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are&#39;,\n &#39; For to thy sensual fault I bring in sense&#39;,\n &#39; Thy adverse party is thy advocate&#39;,\n &#34; And &#39;gainst my self a lawful plea commence&#34;,\n &#39; Such civil war is in my love and hate&#39;,\n &#39; That I an accessary needs must be&#39;,\n &#39; To that sweet thief which sourly robs from me&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39; 36&#39;,\n &#39; Let me confess that we two must be twain&#39;,\n &#39; Although our undivided loves are one&#39;,\n &#39; So shall those blots that do with me remain&#39;,\n &#39; Without thy help by me be borne alone&#39;,\n &#39; In our two loves there is but one respect&#39;,\n &#39; Though in our lives a separable spite&#39;,\n &#34; Which though it alter not love&#39;s sole effect&#34;,\n &#34; Yet doth it steal sweet hours from love&#39;s delight&#34;,\n &#39; I may not evermore acknowledge thee&#39;,\n &#39; Lest my bewailed guilt should do thee shame&#39;,\n &#39; Nor thou with public kindness honour me&#39;,\n &#39; Unless thou take that honour from thy name&#39;,\n &#39; But do not so I love thee in such sort&#39;,\n &#39; As thou being mine mine is thy good report&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39; 37&#39;,\n &#39; As a decrepit father takes delight&#39;,\n &#39; To see his active child do deeds of youth&#39;,\n &#34; So I made lame by Fortune&#39;s dearest spite&#34;,\n &#39; Take all my comfort of thy worth and truth&#39;,\n &#39; For whether beauty birth or wealth or wit&#39;,\n &#39; Or any of these all or all or more&#39;,\n &#39; Entitled in thy parts do crowned sit&#39;,\n &#39; I make my love engrafted to this store&#39;,\n &#39; So then I am not lame poor nor despised&#39;,\n &#39; Whilst that this shadow doth such substance give&#39;,\n &#39; That I in thy abundance am sufficed&#39;,\n &#39; And by a part of all thy glory live&#39;,\n &#39; Look what is best that best I wish in thee&#39;,\n &#39; This wish I have then ten times happy me&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39; 38&#39;,\n &#39; How can my muse want subject to invent&#39;,\n &#34; While thou dost breathe that pour&#39;st into my verse&#34;,\n &#39; Thine own sweet argument too excellent&#39;,\n &#39; For every vulgar paper to rehearse&#39;,\n &#39; O give thy self the thanks if aught in me&#39;,\n &#39; Worthy perusal stand against thy sight&#39;,\n &#34; For who&#39;s so dumb that cannot write to thee&#34;,\n &#39; When thou thy self dost give invention light&#39;,\n &#39; Be thou the tenth Muse ten times more in worth&#39;,\n &#39; Than those old nine which rhymers invocate&#39;,\n &#39; And he that calls on thee let him bring forth&#39;,\n &#39; Eternal numbers to outlive long date&#39;,\n &#39; If my slight muse do please these curious days&#39;,\n &#39; The pain be mine but thine shall be the praise&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39; 39&#39;,\n &#39; O how thy worth with manners may I sing&#39;,\n &#39; When thou art all the better part of me&#39;,\n &#39; What can mine own praise to mine own self bring&#39;,\n &#34; And what is&#39;t but mine own when I praise thee&#34;,\n &#39; Even for this let us divided live&#39;,\n &#39; And our dear love lose name of single one&#39;,\n &#39; That by this separation I may give&#39;,\n &#34; That due to thee which thou deserv&#39;st alone&#34;,\n &#39; O absence what a torment wouldst thou prove&#39;,\n &#39; Were it not thy sour leisure gave sweet leave&#39;,\n &#39; To entertain the time with thoughts of love&#39;,\n &#39; Which time and thoughts so sweetly doth deceive&#39;,\n &#39; And that thou teachest how to make one twain&#39;,\n &#39; By praising him here who doth hence remain&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39; 40&#39;,\n &#39; Take all my loves my love yea take them all&#39;,\n &#39; What hast thou then more than thou hadst before&#39;,\n &#39; No love my love that thou mayst true love call&#39;,\n &#39; All mine was thine before thou hadst this more&#39;,\n &#39; Then if for my love thou my love receivest&#39;,\n &#39; I cannot blame thee for my love thou usest&#39;,\n &#39; But yet be blamed if thou thy self deceivest&#39;,\n &#39; By wilful taste of what thy self refusest&#39;,\n &#39; I do forgive thy robbery gentle thief&#39;,\n &#39; Although thou steal thee all my poverty&#39;,\n &#39; And yet love knows it is a greater grief&#39;,\n &#34; To bear greater wrong than hate&#39;s known injury&#34;,\n &#39; Lascivious grace in whom all ill well shows&#39;,\n &#39; Kill me with spites yet we must not be foes&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39; 41&#39;,\n &#39; Those pretty wrongs that liberty commits&#39;,\n &#39; When I am sometime absent from thy heart&#39;,\n &#39; Thy beauty and thy years full well befits&#39;,\n &#39; For still temptation follows where thou art&#39;,\n &#39; Gentle thou art and therefore to be won&#39;,\n &#39; Beauteous thou art therefore to be assailed&#39;,\n &#34; And when a woman woos what woman&#39;s son&#34;,\n &#39; Will sourly leave her till he have prevailed&#39;,\n &#39; Ay me but yet thou mightst my seat forbear&#39;,\n &#39; And chide thy beauty and thy straying youth&#39;,\n &#39; Who lead thee in their riot even there&#39;,\n &#39; Where thou art forced to break a twofold truth&#39;,\n &#39; Hers by thy beauty tempting her to thee&#39;,\n &#39; Thine by thy beauty being false to me&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39; 42&#39;,\n &#39; That thou hast her it is not all my grief&#39;,\n &#39; And yet it may be said I loved her dearly&#39;,\n &#39; That she hath thee is of my wailing chief&#39;,\n &#39; A loss in love that touches me more nearly&#39;,\n &#39; Loving offenders thus I will excuse ye&#39;,\n &#34; Thou dost love her because thou know&#39;st I love her&#34;,\n &#39; And for my sake even so doth she abuse me&#39;,\n &#34; Suff&#39;ring my friend for my sake to approve her&#34;,\n &#34; If I lose thee my loss is my love&#39;s gain&#34;,\n &#39; And losing her my friend hath found that loss&#39;,\n &#39; Both find each other and I lose both twain&#39;,\n &#39; And both for my sake lay on me this cross&#39;,\n &#34; But here&#39;s the joy my friend and I are one&#34;,\n &#39; Sweet flattery then she loves but me alone&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39; 43&#39;,\n &#39; When most I wink then do mine eyes best see&#39;,\n &#39; For all the day they view things unrespected&#39;,\n &#39; But when I sleep in dreams they look on thee&#39;,\n &#39; And darkly bright are bright in dark directed&#39;,\n &#39; Then thou whose shadow shadows doth make bright&#39;,\n &#34; How would thy shadow&#39;s form form happy show&#34;,\n &#39; To the clear day with thy much clearer light&#39;,\n &#39; When to unseeing eyes thy shade shines so&#39;,\n &#39; How would I say mine eyes be blessed made&#39;,\n &#39; By looking on thee in the living day&#39;,\n &#39; When in dead night thy fair imperfect shade&#39;,\n &#39; Through heavy sleep on sightless eyes doth stay&#39;,\n &#39; All days are nights to see till I see thee&#39;,\n &#39; And nights bright days when dreams do show thee me&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39; 44&#39;,\n &#39; If the dull substance of my flesh were thought&#39;,\n &#39; Injurious distance should not stop my way&#39;,\n &#39; For then despite of space I would be brought&#39;,\n &#39; From limits far remote where thou dost stay&#39;,\n &#39; No matter then although my foot did stand&#39;,\n &#39; Upon the farthest earth removed from thee&#39;,\n &#39; For nimble thought can jump both sea and land&#39;,\n &#39; As soon as think the place where he would be&#39;,\n &#39; But ah thought kills me that I am not thought&#39;,\n &#39; To leap large lengths of miles when thou art gone&#39;,\n &#39; But that so much of earth and water wrought&#39;,\n &#34; I must attend time&#39;s leisure with my moan&#34;,\n &#39; Receiving nought by elements so slow&#39;,\n &#34; But heavy tears badges of either&#39;s woe&#34;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39; 45&#39;,\n &#39; The other two slight air and purging fire&#39;,\n &#39; Are both with thee wherever I abide&#39;,\n &#39; The first my thought the other my desire&#39;,\n &#39; These present absent with swift motion slide&#39;,\n &#39; For when these quicker elements are gone&#39;,\n &#39; In tender embassy of love to thee&#39;,\n &#39; My life being made of four with two alone&#39;,\n &#39; Sinks down to death oppressed with melancholy&#39;,\n &#34; Until life&#39;s composition be recured&#34;,\n &#39; By those swift messengers returned from thee&#39;,\n &#39; Who even but now come back again assured&#39;,\n &#39; Of thy fair health recounting it to me&#39;,\n &#39; This told I joy but then no longer glad&#39;,\n &#39; I send them back again and straight grow sad&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39; 46&#39;,\n &#39; Mine eye and heart are at a mortal war&#39;,\n &#39; How to divide the conquest of thy sight&#39;,\n &#34; Mine eye my heart thy picture&#39;s sight would bar&#34;,\n &#39; My heart mine eye the freedom of that right&#39;,\n &#39; My heart doth plead that thou in him dost lie&#39;,\n &#39; A closet never pierced with crystal eyes&#39;,\n &#39; But the defendant doth that plea deny&#39;,\n &#39; And says in him thy fair appearance lies&#39;,\n &#39; To side this title is impanelled&#39;,\n &#39; A quest of thoughts all tenants to the heart&#39;,\n &#39; And by their verdict is determined&#39;,\n &#34; The clear eye&#39;s moiety and the dear heart&#39;s part&#34;,\n &#34; As thus mine eye&#39;s due is thy outward part&#34;,\n &#34; And my heart&#39;s right thy inward love of heart&#34;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39; 47&#39;,\n &#39; Betwixt mine eye and heart a league is took&#39;,\n &#39; And each doth good turns now unto the other&#39;,\n &#39; When that mine eye is famished for a look&#39;,\n &#39; Or heart in love with sighs himself doth smother&#39;,\n &#34; With my love&#39;s picture then my eye doth feast&#34;,\n &#39; And to the painted banquet bids my heart&#39;,\n &#34; Another time mine eye is my heart&#39;s guest&#34;,\n &#39; And in his thoughts of love doth share a part&#39;,\n &#39; So either by thy picture or my love&#39;,\n &#39; Thy self away art present still with me&#39;,\n &#39; For thou not farther than my thoughts canst move&#39;,\n &#39; And I am still with them and they with thee&#39;,\n &#39; Or if they sleep thy picture in my sight&#39;,\n &#34; Awakes my heart to heart&#39;s and eye&#39;s delight&#34;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39; 48&#39;,\n &#39; How careful was I when I took my way&#39;,\n &#39; Each trifle under truest bars to thrust&#39;,\n &#39; That to my use it might unused stay&#39;,\n &#39; From hands of falsehood in sure wards of trust&#39;,\n &#39; But thou to whom my jewels trifles are&#39;,\n &#39; Most worthy comfort now my greatest grief&#39;,\n &#39; Thou best of dearest and mine only care&#39;,\n &#39; Art left the prey of every vulgar thief&#39;,\n &#39; Thee have I not locked up in any chest&#39;,\n &#39; Save where thou art not though I feel thou art&#39;,\n &#39; Within the gentle closure of my breast&#39;,\n &#39; From whence at pleasure thou mayst come and part&#39;,\n &#34; And even thence thou wilt be stol&#39;n I fear&#34;,\n &#39; For truth proves thievish for a prize so dear&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39; 49&#39;,\n &#39; Against that time if ever that time come&#39;,\n &#39; When I shall see thee frown on my defects&#39;,\n &#39; When as thy love hath cast his utmost sum&#39;,\n &#39; Called to
